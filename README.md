# dodge-the-creeps

I built this version of Dodge the Creeps by following [the official Godot tutorial for 2D games](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html).

I added the following features:
- Speed penalty when moving diagonally
- Boost mechanic with stamina limit
- Creeps get faster over time

Other ideas:
- randomly spawn orbs that give bonus points when picked up (WIP)
- give the player some way to destroy the creeps (power up orbs?)
