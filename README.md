# dodge-the-creeps

I built this version of Dodge the Creeps by following [the official Godot tutorial for 2D games](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html).

I also added a "boost" mechanic and a speed penalty when moving diagonally.

Other ideas:
	- randomly spawn orbs that give bonus points when picked up
	- increase enemey speed/size as time passes (+5% speed and size for each 15/30 seconds played)
	- give the player some way to destroy the creeps (power up orbs?)
